Takachi's Nmap Automation Tool

Hello everyone! üëã My name is Takachi, and I created this tool so we can have some fun together. üòÑ

This script may seem basic, but trust me, it‚Äôs super efficient especially for beginners and "scriptkiddies" out there (no offense, I respect y‚Äôall!). It automates multiple basic Nmap scans, saving you time searching for commands like:  
- "How to escape a firewall with Nmap?" 
- "How can I... kiss my neck with Nmap?!" (LMAO ü§£).

Note:
This tool is great for beginners looking to learn ethical hacking. If you‚Äôre already advanced, though... what are you even doing here, bro? üòÖ
